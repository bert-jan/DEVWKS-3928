# About this Workshop
The Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller (NDFC) is the next generation of DCNM (Data Center Network Manager) which is the network management platform for all NX-OS-enabled deployments. In this session, we will cover how Ansible and NDFC can be used to provide various automation and orchestration capabilities to operate your Datacenter. We will walk through the process of getting started with the Ansible NDFC collection and then explore the resources available within the collection to help manage your VXLAN EVPN fabric. Next, we will walk you through the IaC (Infrastructure as Code) journey by using Gitlab and Ansible to fully automate the network with a CI/CD pipeline.
